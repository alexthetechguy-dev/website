Hi there! Welcome to my site!

On my site I will be covering will be a mix of technical topics which I won't go into detail here!
Also keen to share experiences with new and old video games on many platforms as well as some films, and books.

If you're into sci-fi and fantasy it would be good to connect. I'm also looking to bring out my guitar at some point and jamming to some good tunes.

Anyway my site is a little bit of fun and not meant to be serious. It doesn't have any bells and whistles! If I decide to post on a schedule I will make clear on the site. I aim at some point of the weekend I can, and blogs can be scheduled in advance.
